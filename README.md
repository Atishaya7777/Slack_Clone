This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This is an initial draft of a slack clone which I did with the guidance of Sonny's Slack clone video. (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiTq5WrWoJw). It's a really informative video for beginner level react developers. One thing to note is that please for the love of God use "compat" when importing the modules (Docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade).

This project used React.js, Redux.js, and Firebase hooks.

The deployed version of this project is here: https://slack-clone-yt-5d5e2.web.app.
